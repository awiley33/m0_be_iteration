# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
It might be useful to alter an already defined dataset, for example to set a curve on an exam. It can also be useful to choose only certain items from a dataset.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
I need to practice searching for specific pieces of technical information. I struggled with the problem where it asked for only names that begun with "P".
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
For some answers, I started to look for a Ruby array method on Google before realizing that I could write the answer using Conditionals. I'm finding that my knowledge is growing and it helped that I pulled things from different lessons to solve problems in this one.
